A fun take on the Monty Hall problem, written in Golang.

# The Monty Hall problem

**'Monty Hall'** huh, Sound familiar? The 90's British comedy _'Monty Python'_ is actually completely unrelated. The Monty Hall problem is a mathematical theory by American Statistician, Steve Selvin.

It's named after the original host of the show [Lets make a deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Make_a_Deal)

## Doors Of Sauron

You are locked in a dark chamber deep within the lands of Mordor, with nothing but a flickering computer terminal. Strange symbols scroll across the screen:

"Greetings, traveller. You have stumbled upon the ancient puzzle of the Doors of Sauron. Before you stand three impenetrable doors, each guarded by vicious orcs. Behind one is freedom, behind the others, certain doom. Choose wisely!".

You quickly realize this is no ordinary logic puzzle. The sinister program controlling the doors seems to unpredictably change the rules and actively work against you, cruelly toying with your hopes.

As you struggle to discern the cryptic patterns in the machine's behavior, you begin to unravel disturbing secrets. This is no mere game - somehow you must break the code, outwit the treacherous game logic, and escape before it claims your life!

Built with Go, Doors of Sauron procedurally generates a series of logic challenges in a sinister, interactive fiction style. Can you defeat the maze of deception and make it out alive?
